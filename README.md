# Plugins-or-An-Essential-Tool-for-SaaS-Companies

## Overview
Add-ons are a perfect way for businesses to equip their clients with necessary features without having to code everything from ground zero. Simply, companies can centralize their efforts on key services, leaving the add-ons to manage auxiliary tasks.

Especially in the email marketing domain, the majority of ESPs direct their resources towards perfecting delivery, analytics, and data collection tools. Augmenting their present email editors often takes a back seat. That's where Stripo’s add-on comes in.

This add-on is designed to seamlessly integrate into various platforms, such as websites, CRMs, ESPs, or any software requiring a cutting-edge email editor.

## Who Can Benefit?

### Startups
For startups short on time and budget, Stripo’s add-on acts as a quick and cost-effective solution to elevate customer satisfaction.

### Businesses
For enterprises whose main offerings are only marginally related to email creation—like webinar platforms or e-learning systems—our add-on supplies a modern email editor.

### Enterprises/Professionals
Companies whose focal point is email marketing can use our add-on to stay focused on core operations, while we manage email creation for clients.
